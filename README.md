# Angular Material Sample Application

This sample application is a To-Do list using [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/), which implements Google's Material Design specification in an Angular-specific way. I created it so that I could try out this library. It does not make use of a backend or cookies, so the to-do items will only be available for as long as the page is open.


## Usage

[Try it out here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/LaMarseillaise/angular-material-sample/blob/master/index.html).

Items can be added and removed from to the to-do list, marked completed, and hidden based on their completion.
